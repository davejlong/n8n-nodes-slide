# n8n-nodes-slide

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use [Slide](https://slide.tech) in your n8n workflows.

> Slide offers a Modern Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Solution Purpose-built for MSPs. The legacy backup solutions rely on outdated technology and offer substandard support. Slide has reimagined the BCDR from the ground up by combining modern software, high-performance hardware, and end-to-end encryption at no extra cost. The result is a faster, more secure, more cost-effective solution.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
